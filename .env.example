# frontend env configuration

# === API Configuration ===

#TO DO: 
# - in Railway dashboard go to project environment variables
# - there will be a default generated url that we can adapt e.g., http://gig-buddy.up.railway.app/api
# - in Railway's env. variables, set REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=our-railway-url

REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
#function: sets the base url for API calls from the React frontend
#why:facilitates communication with the backend API, so can use in local development (until production - when Railway overrides)
#how:Axios/fetch requests prepend (add something to the beginning of a string/sequence) this url to the API endpoint paths. 
#how: ... so if the code calls /users, the url is prepended to 'users', and when railway overrides it replaces the url

# === App Configuration ===
REACT_APP_APP_NAME= Gig Buddy 
#function: displays app name in UI
REACT_APP_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
#function: shows app version for version tracking and display (rendered in UI or console logs)

# === Feature Flags ===
REACT_APP_ENABLE_SOCIAL_LOGIN=false
#function: toggles social login feature - aka stops people from trying to login with social accounts like Google
#how: the app hides buttons for logging in with other accounts, only allowing regular password login
REACT_APP_ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=true
#function: enables/disables notifications
#why: so the app can send pop-up notifications 
#how: checked before initialising notifcation APIs

#QUERY: ^^^ do we want this ?? 

REACT_APP_ENABLE_PWA=true
#function: activates PWA features - makes website act like an app and use it even when not connected to internet
#why: for offline/app-like experience
#how: react uses this to add code allowing it to save media etc. for offline use

# === Analytics (optional) ===
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
#function: tracks user interactions
#why: for analytics insights
#how: initialises Google Analytics SDK


# === External Services (optional) ===
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
#function:hosts images
#why: for media storage
#how: used in upload URLs

# Build Configuration
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=true
#function: generates source maps for debugging
#how: set in build scripts (not always in .env)

# Development Configuration
PORT=3000
#function: sets dev server port (customises the local port and overrides CRA default)
#why: CRA [create react app] runs the dev server on port 3000 by default, which can cause issues if you are using it for another app etc ...
#why: ... in which case, change to another free port but make sure it's not 3001 (i.e. same as the backend port!)
BROWSER=none
#function: prevents auto-opening browser

# === Environment ===
NODE_ENV=development
#function:indicates app environment
#why: controls dev vs production behaviour
#how: checked in code for dev tool features
